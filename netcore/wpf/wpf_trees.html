        <h4>Elements Tree</h4>
        <p>
          There are many technologies where the elements and components are
          ordered in a tree structure so that the programmers can easily handle
          the object and change the behavior of an application. Windows
          Presentation Foundation (WPF) has a comprehensive tree structure in
          the form of objects. In WPF, there are two ways that a complete object
          tree is conceptualized &#x2212;
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Logical Tree Structures</li>
          <li>Visual Tree Structures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the help of these tree structures, you can easily create and
          identify the relationship between UI elements. Mostly, WPF developers
          and designers either use procedural language to create an application
          or design the UI part of the application in XAML keeping in mind the
          object tree structure

        <h4>Logical Tree Structure</h4>
        <p>
          In WPF applications, the structure of the UI elements in XAML
          represents the logical tree structure. In XAML, the basic elements of
          UI are declared by the developer. The logical tree in WPF defines the
          following &#x2212;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dependency Properties</li>
          <li>Static and Dynamic resources</li>
          <li>Binding the elements on its name etc</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;Window x:Class = &#x22;WPFElementsTree.MainWindow&#x22; 
xmlns = &#x22;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&#x22; 
xmlns:x = &#x22;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&#x22;
Title = &#x22;MainWindow&#x22; Height = &#x22;350&#x22; Width = &#x22;604&#x22;&#x3E; 
&#x9;
&#x3C;StackPanel&#x3E; 
    &#x3C;Button x:Name = &#x22;button&#x22; Height = &#x22;30&#x22; Width = &#x22;70&#x22; Content = &#x22;OK&#x22; Margin = &#x22;20&#x22; /&#x3E; 
&#x9;&#x9;
    &#x3C;ListBox x:Name = &#x22;listBox&#x22; Height = &#x22;100&#x22; Width = &#x22;100&#x22; Margin = &#x22;20&#x22;&#x3E; 
        &#x3C;ListBoxItem Content = &#x22;Item 1&#x22; /&#x3E; 
        &#x3C;ListBoxItem Content = &#x22;Item 2&#x22; /&#x3E; 
        &#x3C;ListBoxItem Content = &#x22;Item 3&#x22; /&#x3E; 
    &#x3C;/ListBox&#x3E; 
&#x9;&#x9;
&#x3C;/StackPanel&#x3E; 
&#x9;
&#x3C;/Window&#x3E; </code></pre>
        <p>
          If you look at the XAML code, you will observe a tree structure, i.e.
          the root node is the Window and inside the root node, there is only
          one child, that is StackPanel. But StackPanel contains two child
          elements, button and list box. List box has three more child list box
          items.

        <h4>Visual Tree Structure</h4>
        <p>
          In WPF, the concept of the visual tree describes the structure of
          visual objects, as represented by the Visual Base Class. It signifies
          all the UI elements which are rendered to the output screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a programmer wants to create a template for a particular control,
          he is actually rendering the visual tree of that control. The visual
          tree is also very useful for those who want to draw lower level
          controls for performance and optimization reasons.
        </p>
        <p>In WPF applications, visual tree is used for &#x2212;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rendering the visual objects</li>
          <li>Rendering the layouts.</li>
          <li>
            The routed events mostly travel along the visual tree, not the
            logical tree
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The visual tree is typically a superset of the logical tree. You can
          see here that all the logical elements are also present in the visual
          tree. So these two trees are really just two different views of the
          same set of objects that make up the UI.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The logical tree leaves out a lot of detail enabling you to focus on
            the core structure of the user interface and to ignore the details
            of exactly how it has been presented.
          </li>
          <li>
            The logical tree is what you use to create the basic structure of
            the user interface
          </li>
          <li>
            The visual tree will be of interest if you're focusing on the
            presentation. For example, if you wish to customize the appearance
            of any UI element, you will need to use the visual tree.
