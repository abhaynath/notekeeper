        <h4>Command</h4>
        <p>
          Command allows you to define actions in one place and then refer to
          them from all your user interface controls like menu items, toolbar
          buttons and so on. WPF will also listen for keyboard shortcuts and
          pass them along to the proper command, if any, making it the ideal way
          to offer keyboard shortcuts in an application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commands also solve another hassle when dealing with multiple
          entrances to the same function. In a WinForms application, you would
          be responsible for writing code that could disable user interface
          elements when the action was not available. For instance, if your
          application was able to use a clipboard command like Cut, but only
          when text was selected, you would have to manually enable and disable
          the main menu item, the toolbar button and the context menu item each
          time text selection changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          With WPF commands, this is centralized. With one method you decide
          whether or not a given command can be executed, and then WPF toggles
          all the subscribing interface elements on or off automatically. This
          makes it so much easier to create a responsive and dynamic
          application!
        </p>
        <h4>Command Bindings</h4>
        <p>
          Commands don&#x27;t actually do anything by them self. At the root,
          they consist of the <span class="keyword">ICommand</span> interface,
          which only defines an event and two methods:
          <span class="keyword">Execute()</span> and
          <span class="keyword">CanExecute()</span>. The first one is for
          performing the actual action, while the second one is for determining
          whether the action is currently available. To perform the actual
          action of the command, you need a link between the command and your
          code and this is where the CommandBinding comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CommandBinding is usually defined on a Window or a UserControl, and
          holds a references to the Command that it handles, as well as the
          actual event handlers for dealing with the
          <span class="keyword">Execute()</span> and
          <span class="keyword">CanExecute()</span>
          events of the Command.

        <h4>Using WPF Command</h4>
        <p>
          In the previous article, we discussed a lot of theory about what
          commands are and how they work. In this chapter, we&#x27;ll look into
          how you actually use commands, by assigning them to user interface
          elements and creating command bindings that links it all together.

&#x9;&#x9;{
&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;MessageBox.Show(&#x22;The New command was invoked&#x22;);
&#x9;&#x9;}
&#x9;}
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          We define a command binding on the Window, by adding it to its
          CommandBindings collection. We specify that Command that we wish to
          use (the New command from the ApplicationCommands), as well as two
          event handlers. The visual interface consists of a single button,
          which we attach the command to using the Command property.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Code-behind, we handle the two events. The CanExecute handler,
          which WPF will call when the application is idle to see if the
          specific command is currently available, is very simple for this
          example, as we want this particular command to be available all the
          time. This is done by setting the CanExecute property of the event
          arguments to true.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Executed handler simply shows a message box when the command is
          invoked. If you run the sample and press the button, you will see this
          message. A thing to notice is that this command has a default keyboard
          shortcut defined, which you get as an added bonus. Instead of clicking
          the button, you can try to press Ctrl+N on your keyboard - the result
          is the same.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="wpf_01_03">
        <h4>Using CanExecute method</h4>
        <p>
          In the first example, we implemented a CanExecute event that simply
          returned true, so that the button would be available all the time.
          However, this is of course not true for all buttons - in many cases,
          you want the button to be enabled or disabled depending on some sort
          of state in your application.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very common example of this is the toggling of buttons for using the
          Windows Clipboard, where you want the Cut and Copy buttons to be
          enabled only when text is selected, and the Paste button to only be
          enabled when text is present in the clipboard. This is exactly what
          we&#x27;ll accomplish in this example:

        <p>
          So, we have this very simple interface with a couple of buttons and a
          TextBox control. The first button will cut to the clipboard and the
          second one will paste from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Code-behind, we have two events for each button: One that performs
          the actual action, which name ends with _Executed, and then the
          CanExecute events. In each of them, you will see that I apply some
          logic to decide whether or not the action can be executed and then
          assign it to the return value CanExecute on the EventArgs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cool thing about this is that you don&#x27;t have to call these
          methods to have your buttons updated - WPF does it automatically when
          the application has an idle moment, making sure that you interface
          remains updated all the time.

        <h4>Default command behavior and CommandTarget</h4>
        <p>
          As we saw in the previous example, handling a set of commands can lead
          to quite a bit of code, with a lot of being method declarations and
          very standard logic. That&#x27;s probably why the WPF team decided to
          handle some it for you. In fact, we could have avoided all of the
          Code-behind in the previous example, because a WPF TextBox can
          automatically handle common commands like Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and
          Redo.
        </p>
        <p>
          WPF does this by handling the Executed and CanExecute events for you,
          when a text input control like the TextBox has focus. You are free to
          override these events, which is basically what we did in the previous
          example, but if you just want the basic behavior, you can let WPF
          connect the commands and the TextBox control and do the work for you.
          Just see how much simpler this example is:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;Window x:Class=&#x22;WpfTutorialSamples.Commands.CommandsWithCommandTargetSample&#x22;
          xmlns=&#x22;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&#x22;
          xmlns:x=&#x22;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&#x22;
          Title=&#x22;CommandsWithCommandTargetSample&#x22; Height=&#x22;200&#x22; Width=&#x22;250&#x22;&#x3E;
      &#x3C;DockPanel&#x3E;
          &#x3C;WrapPanel DockPanel.Dock=&#x22;Top&#x22; Margin=&#x22;3&#x22;&#x3E;
              &#x3C;Button Command=&#x22;ApplicationCommands.Cut&#x22; CommandTarget=&#x22;{Binding ElementName=txtEditor}&#x22; Width=&#x22;60&#x22;&#x3E;_Cut&#x3C;/Button&#x3E;
              &#x3C;Button Command=&#x22;ApplicationCommands.Paste&#x22; CommandTarget=&#x22;{Binding ElementName=txtEditor}&#x22; Width=&#x22;60&#x22; Margin=&#x22;3,0&#x22;&#x3E;_Paste&#x3C;/Button&#x3E;
          &#x3C;/WrapPanel&#x3E;
          &#x3C;TextBox AcceptsReturn=&#x22;True&#x22; Name=&#x22;txtEditor&#x22; /&#x3E;
      &#x3C;/DockPanel&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/Window&#x3E;</code></pre>

        <p>
          No Code-behind code needed for this example - WPF deals with all of it
          for us, but only because we want to use these specific commands for
          this specific control. The TextBox does the work for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how I use the CommandTarget properties on the buttons, to bind
          the commands to our TextBox control. This is required in this
          particular example, because the WrapPanel doesn't handle focus the
          same way e.g. a Toolbar or a Menu would, but it also makes pretty good
          sense to give the commands a target.

        <h4>Implementing a custom command</h4>
        <p>
          In the previous chapter, we looked at various ways of using commands
          already defined in WPF, but of course, you can implement your own
          commands as well. It&#x27;s pretty simple, and once you&#x27;ve done
          it, you can use your own commands just like the ones defined in WPF.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to start implementing your own commands is to have a
          static class that will contain them. Each command is then added to
          this class as static fields, allowing you to use them in your
          application. Since WPF, for some strange reason, doesn&#x27;t
          implement an Exit/Quit command, I decided to implement one for our
          custom commands example. It looks like this:

        <p>
          In the markup, I&#x27;ve defined a very simple interface with a menu
          and a button, both of them using our new, custom Exit command. This
          command is defined in Code-behind, in our own CustomCommands class,
          and then referenced in the CommandBindings collection of the window,
          where we assign the events that it should use to execute/check if
          it&#x27;s allowed to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this is just like the examples in the previous chapter, except
          for the fact that we&#x27;re referencing the command from our own code
          (using the &#x22;self&#x22; namespace defined in the top) instead of a
          built-in command.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Code-behind, we respond to the two events for our command: One
          event just allows the command to execute all the time, since
          that&#x27;s usually true for an exit/quit command, and the other one
          calls the Shutdown method that will terminate our application. All
          very simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          As already explained, we implement our Exit command as a field on a
          static CustomCommands class. There are several ways of defining and
          assigning properties on the commands, but I&#x27;ve chosen the more
          compact approach (it would be even more compact if placed on the same
          line, but I&#x27;ve added line breaks here for readability) where I
          assign all of it through the constructor. The parameters are the
          text/label of the command, the name of the command, the owner type and
          then an InputGestureCollection, allowing me to define a default
          shortcut for the command (Alt+F4).
