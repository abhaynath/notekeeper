        <h3>Singleton Design Pattern</h3>
        <h4>Intent</h4>
        Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a
        class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to
        this instance.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating
        the Single Responsibility Principle:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Ensure that a class has just a single instance. </b>Why would
              anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most
              common reason for this is to control access to some shared
              resource&#x2014;for example, a database or a file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to
              create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object,
              you&#x2019;ll get the one you already created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular
              constructor since a constructor call must always return a new
              object by design.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Provide a global access point to that instance.</b> Just like a
              global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object
              from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that
              instance from being overwritten by other code.
            </p>
            <p>
              There&#x2019;s another side to this problem: you don&#x2019;t want
              the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your
              program. It&#x2019;s much better to have it within one class,
              especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Solution</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from
            using the <span class="keyword">new</span> operator with the
            Singleton class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under
            the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an
            object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this
            method return the cached object.

            <div>
              <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_singleton.jpg" />
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        It&#x2019;s pretty easy to implement a sloppy Singleton. You just need
        to hide the constructor and implement a static creation method. The same
        class behaves incorrectly in a multithreaded environment. Multiple
        threads can call the creation method simultaneously and get several
        instances of Singleton class.

          <summary>Thread-Safe Singleton</summary>

          To fix the problem, you have to synchronize threads during the first
          creation of the Singleton object.
          <pre><code class="language-csharp">
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace Singleton
{
    // This Singleton implementation is called &#x22;double check lock&#x22;. It is safe
    // in multithreaded environment and provides lazy initialization for the
    // Singleton object.

    {
        private Singleton() { }

        private static Singleton _instance;

        // We now have a lock object that will be used to synchronize threads
        // during first access to the Singleton.
        private static readonly object _lock = new object();

        public static Singleton GetInstance(string value)
        {
            // This conditional is needed to prevent threads stumbling over the
            // lock once the instance is ready.
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                // Now, imagine that the program has just been launched. Since
                // there&#x27;s no Singleton instance yet, multiple threads can
                // simultaneously pass the previous conditional and reach this
                // point almost at the same time. The first of them will acquire
                // lock and will proceed further, while the rest will wait here.
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    // The first thread to acquire the lock, reaches this
                    // conditional, goes inside and creates the Singleton
                    // instance. Once it leaves the lock block, a thread that
                    // might have been waiting for the lock release may then
                    // enter this section. But since the Singleton field is

        <h4>Relation with other Design Patterns</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <a href="cs_dp_facade.html">Facade</a> class can often be
            transformed into a Singleton since a single facade object is
            sufficient in most cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="cs_dp_flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> would resemble
            Singleton if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the
            objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental
            differences between these patterns:
            <ol>
              <li>
                There should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a Flyweight
                class can have multiple instances with different intrinsic
                states.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Singleton object can be mutable. Flyweight objects are
                immutable.
