        <h3>Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern</h3>
        <h4>Intent</h4>
        <p>
          Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce
          families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine that you&#x2019;re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your
          code consists of classes that represent:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair +
              Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern,
              Victorian, ArtDeco.
            </p>
            <div class="space_between">
              <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf1.png" />
              <p>
                You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that
                they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite
                mad when they receive non-matching furniture.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="space_between">
              <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf2.png" />
              <p>
                Also, you don&#x2019;t want to change existing code when adding
                new products or families of products to the program. Furniture
                vendors update their catalogs very often, and you
                wouldn&#x2019;t want to change the core code each time it
                happens.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Solution</h4>

        <p>
          The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly
          declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family
          (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of
          products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can
          implement the Chair interface; all coffee table variants can implement
          the CoffeeTable interface, and so on.
          <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          The next move is to declare the Abstract Factory&#x2014;an interface
          with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the
          product family (for example, createChair, createSofa and
          createCoffeeTable). These methods must return abstract product types
          represented by the interfaces we extracted previously: Chair, Sofa,
          CoffeeTable and so on.
          <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product
          family, we create a separate factory class based on the
          AbstractFactory interface. A factory is a class that returns products
          of a particular kind. For example, the ModernFurnitureFactory can only
          create ModernChair, ModernSofa and ModernCoffeeTable objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client code has to work with both factories and products via their
          respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a
          factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product
          variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual
          client code.
          <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Say the client wants a factory to produce a chair. The client
          doesn&#x2019;t have to be aware of the factory&#x2019;s class, nor
          does it matter what kind of chair it gets. Whether it&#x2019;s a
          Modern model or a Victorian-style chair, the client must treat all
          chairs in the same manner, using the abstract Chair interface. With
          this approach, the only thing that the client knows about the chair is
          that it implements the sitOn method in some way. Also, whichever
          variant of the chair is returned, it&#x2019;ll always match the type
          of sofa or coffee table produced by the same factory object.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#x2019;s one more thing left to clarify: if the client is only
          exposed to the abstract interfaces, what creates the actual factory
          objects? Usually, the application creates a concrete factory object at
          the initialization stage. Just before that, the app must select the
          factory type depending on the configuration or the environment
          settings.
        </p>

        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <div class="space_between">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Abstract Products declare interfaces for a set of distinct but
              related products which make up a product family.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concrete Products are various implementations of abstract
              products, grouped by variants. Each abstract product (chair/sofa)
              must be implemented in all given variants (Victorian/Modern).
            </li>
            <li>
              The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of methods for
              creating each of the abstract products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concrete Factories implement creation methods of the abstract
              factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant
              of products and creates only those product variants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although concrete factories instantiate concrete products,
              signatures of their creation methods must return corresponding
              abstract products. This way the client code that uses a factory
              doesn&#x2019;t get coupled to the specific variant of the product
              it gets from a factory. The Client can work with any concrete
              factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their
              objects via abstract interfaces.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          This example illustrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be used
          for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client
          code to concrete UI classes, while keeping all created elements
          consistent with a selected operating system.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/design_patterns/dp_abf7.png" />
        <p>
          The same UI elements in a cross-platform application are expected to
          behave similarly, but look a little bit different under different
          operating systems. Moreover, it&#x2019;s your job to make sure that
          the UI elements match the style of the current operating system. You
          wouldn&#x2019;t want your program to render macOS controls when
          it&#x2019;s executed in Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of creation methods that
          the client code can use to produce different types of UI elements.
          Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create
          the UI elements that match that particular OS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works like this: when an application launches, it checks the type
          of the current operating system. The app uses this information to
          create a factory object from a class that matches the operating
          system. The rest of the code uses this factory to create UI elements.
          This prevents the wrong elements from being created.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this approach, the client code doesn&#x2019;t depend on concrete
          classes of factories and UI elements as long as it works with these
          objects via their abstract interfaces. This also lets the client code
          support other factories or UI elements that you might add in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, you don&#x2019;t need to modify the client code each time
          you add a new variation of UI elements to your app. You just have to
          create a new factory class that produces these elements and slightly
          modify the app&#x2019;s initialization code so it selects that class
          when appropriate.

        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Map out a matrix of distinct product types versus variants of these
            products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declare abstract product interfaces for all product types. Then make
            all concrete product classes implement these interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declare the abstract factory interface with a set of creation
            methods for all abstract products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement a set of concrete factory classes, one for each product
            variant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create factory initialization code somewhere in the app. It should
            instantiate one of the concrete factory classes, depending on the
            application configuration or the current environment. Pass this
            factory object to all classes that construct products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scan through the code and find all direct calls to product
            constructors. Replace them with calls to the appropriate creation
            method on the factory object.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Relation with other patterns</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many designs start by using Factory Method (less complicated and
            more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward Abstract
            Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, but more
            complicated).
          </li>
          <li>Builder focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects. Abstract Factory returns the product immediately, whereas Builder lets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.</li>
          <li>Abstract Factory classes are often based on a set of Factory Methods, but you can also use Prototype to compose the methods on these classes.</li>
          <li>Abstract Factory can serve as an alternative to Facade when you only want to hide the way the subsystem objects are created from the client code.</li>
          <li>You can use Abstract Factory along with Bridge. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by Bridge can only work with specific implementations. In this case, Abstract Factory can encapsulate these relations and hide the complexity from the client code.</li>
          <li>Abstract Factories, Builders and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons.</li>
