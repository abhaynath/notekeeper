        <h3>Factory Method Design Pattern (Virtual constructor)</h3>
        <h4>Intent</h4>
        Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type
        of objects that will be created.
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div class="space_between">
          <img src="../../../images/design_patterns/dp_factory1.png" />
          <div>
            <p>
              Imagine that you&#x2019;re creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by
              <span class="keyword">Track</span>s, so the bulk of your code lives inside the <span class="keyword">Track</span> class.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea
              logistics into the app.
            </p>
            <b>Adding a new class to the program isn&#x2019;t that simple if the rest of the code is already coupled to existing classes.</b>

            <p>
              Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the
              <span class="keyword">Track</span> class. Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you
              decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app&#x2019;s behavior depending on the class of
              transportation objects.

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div class="space_between">
          <img src="../../../images/design_patterns/dp_factory2.png" />
          <div>
            <p>
              The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory
              method. Don&#x2019;t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it&#x2019;s being called from within the factory method.
              Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.
            </p>

            <p>
              At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider
              this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="space_between">
          <div>
            <p>
              There&#x2019;s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or
              interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.
              <b>All products must follow the same interface.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface, which declares a method called deliver. Each class implements
              this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck
              objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="../../../images/design_patterns/dp_factory3.png" />
            <b>As long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking it.</b>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="space_between">
          <p>
            The code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesn&#x2019;t see a difference between the actual products returned by various
            subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver
            method, but exactly how it works isn&#x2019;t important to the client.
          </p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>The Product declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.</li>
          <li>Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface.</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It&#x2019;s important that the return type of this method matches
              the product interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base
              factory method can return some default product type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core
              business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large
              software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still
              writing code, not producing programmers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.</p>
            <p>
              Note that the factory method doesn&#x2019;t have to create new instances all the time. It can also return existing objects from a cache, an object
              pool, or another source.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="../../../images/design_patterns/dp_factory4.png" />
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Make all products follow the same interface. This interface should declare methods that make sense in every product.</li>
          <li>Add an empty factory method inside the creator class. The return type of the method should match the common product interface.</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the creator&#x2019;s code find all references to product constructors. One by one, replace them with calls to the factory method, while
              extracting the product creation code into the factory method.
            </p>
            <p>You might need to add a temporary parameter to the factory method to control the type of returned product.</p>
            <p>
              At this point, the code of the factory method may look pretty ugly. It may have a large switch operator that picks which product class to
              instantiate. But don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;ll fix it soon enough.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, create a set of creator subclasses for each type of product listed in the factory method. Override the factory method in the subclasses and
            extract the appropriate bits of construction code from the base method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If there are too many product types and it doesnâ€™t make sense to create subclasses for all of them, you can reuse the control parameter from the
              base class in subclasses.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, imagine that you have the following hierarchy of classes: the base Mail class with a couple of subclasses: AirMail and GroundMail;
              the Transport classes are Plane, Truck and Train. While the AirMail class only uses Plane objects, GroundMail may work with both Truck and Train
              objects. You can create a new subclass (say TrainMail) to handle both cases, but there&#x2019;s another option. The client code can pass an
              argument to the factory method of the GroundMail class to control which product it wants to receive.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            If, after all of the extractions, the base factory method has become empty, you can make it abstract. If there&#x2019;s something left, you can make
            it a default behavior of the method.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Another Example</h4>
        <p>
          This example illustrates how the Factory Method can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="../../../images/design_patterns/dp_factory6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          The base dialog class uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit
          different, but they should still behave consistently. A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the factory method comes into play, you don&#x2019;t need to rewrite the logic of the dialog for each operating system. If we declare a factory
          method that produces buttons inside the base dialog class, we can later create a dialog subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory
          method. The subclass then inherits most of the dialog&#x2019;s code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory method, can render Windows-looking
          buttons on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this pattern to work, the base dialog class must work with abstract buttons: a base class or an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This
          way the dialog&#x2019;s code remains functional, whichever type of buttons it works with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory method you add to the dialog, you get closer to
          the <a href="cs_dp_abstract_factory.html">Abstract Factory pattern</a>. We&#x2019;ll talk about this pattern later.
